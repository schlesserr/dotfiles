  ### Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  ### as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing
  ### I've given in 14 spacing which fits really well with my fonts, you may change it
  ### to your convenience but make sure to adjust 'glyph_offset' appropriately post that
  #offset:
    #x: 0 

  ## Note: This requires RESTART
  ## By default when you change the offset above you'll see an issue, where the texts are bottom
  ## aligned with the cursor, this is to make sure they center align.
  ## This offset should usually be 1/2 of the above offset-y being set.
  #glyph_offset:
    #x: 0
   ## Keeping this as half of offset to vertically align the text in cursor
